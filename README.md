Apollo Hospitals was established in 1983, renowned as the architect of modern healthcare in India. As the nation's first corporate hospital, Apollo Hospitals is acclaimed for pioneering the private healthcare revolution in the country.
As a data scientist working at Apollo 24/7, the ultimate goal is to tease out meaningful and actionable insights from Patient-level collected data.
You can help Apollo hospitals to be more efficient, to influence diagnostic and treatment processes, to map the spread of a pandemic.
One of the best examples of data scientists making a meaningful difference at a global level is in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, where they have improved information collection, provided ongoing and accurate estimates of infection spread and health system demand, and assessed the effectiveness of government policies.

The company wants to know:
• Which variables are significant in predicting the reason for hospitalization for different regions
